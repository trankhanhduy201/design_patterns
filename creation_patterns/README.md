# Creation Patterns

Creational patterns provide the strategic way to create objects without hard-coding their types.

---

## Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Builder Pattern
The Builder Pattern is used to break down the construction of a complex object into manageable steps, enabling different configurations of the same object using the same construction process.

## Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern lets you create objects without specifying their exact class by using a common interface and delegating the creation to a separate factory. It centralizes object creation based on input or configuration.
